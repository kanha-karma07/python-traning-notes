# Day 01 – Python Basics

## 1) Python Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
- Easy to Learn: Python's syntax is clear and intuitive, making it perfect for beginners
- Versatile: Used in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more
- Large Community: Extensive libraries and active community support
- High Demand: One of the most sought-after skills in the job market


## 2) Python Installation
- Download Python from:
  - https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Check if Python is installed
- python --version
- python -V
- py --version

## 3) Python Syntax

- Correct Syntax 
 - if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!") ✅

- Incorrect Syntax
 -if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
# This will cause an IndentationError ❌
# If you skip the indentation, Python will give you an error

## 4) Python Comment 
### Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
   ### Creating a Comment
      - Comments start with a #, and Python will ignore them:
    ### Example
              #This is a comment
              print("Hello, World!")
### single line Comment
     Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
    print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

### Multi line Comments
    Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
     #This is a comment
     #written in
     #more than just one line
     print("Hello, World!")
 As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
      """
        This is a comment
        written in
        more than just one line
      """
      print("Hello, World!")
